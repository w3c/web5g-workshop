            What is the purpose of this workshop?
          </h2>
          <p>The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together telecommunications operators, network equipment providers, content delivery networks, browser vendors, and application developers to evaluate and prepare for the <strong>impact of 5G and other network-layer technologies on Web standards</strong>.</p>
          <p>
            We won't just be listening to presentations, but we will be actively participating in breakout sessions and working discussions covering <a href="#topics">topics identified as relevant to the participants</a>.
          </p>
          <p>The workshop will cover 5G New Radio (5G-NR), new network topologies resulting from the split of session control from mobility management, and the increasing importance of Network Function Virtualisation, Software Defined Networks and Multi-Access Edge Computing.  It will aim to cut through the 5G hype and instead address what is new in 5G, what was going to happen anyway and where new opportunities lie, putting acronyms and ‘G’s’ to one side.</p>

 
          <h3 id="why-the-web">
            Why the Web is critical to 5G deployment?
          </h3>
          <p>Fifth generation networks (5G) are intended provide higher bandwidth, lower latency and better coverage than today’s 4G networks.  Improvements to both the physical network and its control plane are expected to make the network more reactive, flexible, and with better performances, and enable better cooperation among its end points.</p>
          <p>In setting the direction for 5G, the <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.2083-0-201509-I!!PDF-E.pdf">ITU envisioned ambitious use cases</a>. But while network capabilities are necessary to their realization, the application layer must also be up to the task. Equally the changes in 5G architecture offer the potential for the application layer to interface directly into policy and control functions in the 5G network.</p>

          <p>There are many application platforms to choose from, but the most ubiquitous and scalable is the Open Web Platform — the collection of technologies that enables the Web. The Web plays a predominant role in the distribution of content and services: there are a billion Web sites, most connected devices feature browsers, and software developers <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#developer-roles">identify as “Web developers” far more often</a> than other roles.</p>
          <h3 id="why-5g">
            Why 5G matters to the Web?
          </h3>
          <p>A number of recent advances in Web technology have led to significant increases in network traffic, underlining why it is so important to consider the evolution of the Web and network in tandem. Users will appreciate 5G improvements for network-hungry applications, including:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Real-time audio and video</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/">Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)</a> protocol enables real-time video and audio in both browsers and native mobile applications, without plug-ins. Analysts predict that <a href="http://disruptivewireless.blogspot.fr/p/blog-page_30.html">2 billion people will be making use of this technology by 2019</a> , revolutionizing telecommunications.</dd>
            <dt>Video</dt>
            <dd>In the past few years, video consumption has led to dramatic increases in network traffic, accelerated by the adoption of the HTML5 Web standard. It is easy to imagine the demand skyrocketing as the Web expands to accommodate UHD, HDR, and 360° videos.</dd>
            <dt>Virtual Reality</dt>
            <dd>Though not yet common, there is a lot of excitement about adding immersive virtual reality experiences to the Web for commerce, communication, entertainment, and much more. A <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvr/spec/latest/">WebVR API</a> would make virtual reality a first class citizen of the Web.</dd>
            <dt>Web of Things</dt>
            <dd>The Internet had existed for years when the Web was invented in 1989, but it took the harmonized application platform of the Web to usher in the Internet economy. W3C holds a similar view of the “<a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a>” as a uniform application layer that will make it much easier to develop Internet of Things applications that leverage 5G’s low latency and wide coverage.</dd>
            <dt>Automotive</dt>
            <dd>Connectivity is driving <a href="https://www.w3.org/Auto/">automotive industry interest in platform enhancements</a> for in-vehicle, inter-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure services. APIs from W3C that provide access to external sensors will benefit from 5G’s low latency.</dd>
            <dt>QUIC and protocol innovation</dt>
            <dd>With QUIC expected to bring new performance characteristics to HTTP, and with ongoing discussions to bring QUIC as a primitive in the Web Platform, plenty of network innovation and exploration can be expected via browsers in the years to come.</dd>
            </dl>

          <p>Although different industries emphasize different use cases, in many cases the required capabilities are common to multiple industries. W3C’s diverse, international community of stakeholders helps build the Web for converging requirements across industries.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, many of the expected network evolutions require interactions between the networking and application layer that be at odd with the security and privacy architecture of the Web: it is thus critical that these inconsistencies be understood, mapped, and if possible, corrected.</p>

          <h3 id="future">What is needed to make the Web 5G ready?</h3>
          <p>For many years, the telecommunications industry and other stakeholders at W3C have sought to improve integration of the network protocol layer with Web applications, to improve monitoring of network performance, control of network transport characteristics, and discovery of and interation with of network services.</p>

            <p>We expect that 5G-enabled applications (e.g., automotive, e-health, augmented reality) will require even more fine-grain network customization. We also expect that as more and more network traffic is encrypted, approaches to optimization based on monitoring will lose their effectiveness. These changes call for a more ambitious evolution of the Open Web Platform architecture to address the needs of 5G.</p>
            <p>To ensure that Web improvements for 5G applications scale globally, a flexible architecture ready for customization around  monitoring, control and service discovery is likely needed.</p>

          <h3 id="background">
            Examples of network/application integration
          </h3>

          <p>A number of recent projects have adopted similar approaches to brokering, suggesting such a “Web5G” architecture can be achieved:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://blog.google/topics/internet-access/partnering-toward-next-generation-mobile-networks/">Google worked with 3 telecommunication operators in India</a> to make it easier for their users to download YouTube videos during network off-hours under the "Smart Offline" banner. That cooperation is based on a general mechanism for operators to collaborate with Google applications via the <a href="https://developers.google.com/mobile-data-plan/reference/rest/">Mobile Data Plan API</a></li>
            <li>Google also experimented with good results in using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-flinck-mobile-throughput-guidance-04">MEC Throughput Guidance</a> to enhance video streaming performance.</li>
            <li>Cloudflare is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/">adopting Service Workers</a> to deploy edge computing services.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wang-rtcweb-oars-02">operator-assisted relay service specification</a> proposes an architecture where apps and networks cooperate in setting up optimal relays.</li>
            <li>The <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-3/Optimizing_WiFi_Connectivity_and_Prioritizing_Business_Apps.pdf">collaboration between Cisco and Apple on iOS networking</a> in entreprise networks illustrates how the cooperation of the application layer (mediated by the OS in this case) with the networking layer (as exposed by Cisco routers) can lead to improved performances for identified applications.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Are there lessons from these examples and others that could be usefully generalized to bring greater beneficial integration between networks and the apps they support?</p>
          <h2 id="topics">
            Which topics will be covered?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We will cover important issues and architectural aspects of the intersection of next generation network and Web technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tentative list of topics is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Performance bottlenecks of Web apps on ultra-fast networks</li>
            <li>Designing and costing 5G Networks for supporting existing and future Web technologies (VR/AR, automotive, WebRTC, IoT)</li>
            <li>Architectural evolutions of the Web to enable greater network/application collaboration, in particular for long tail applications developers</li>
            <li>Connecting network management and network metrics from Web applications</li>
            <li>Case studies of existing network/application integration and their extension to the Web</li>
            <li>Features provided by new networking technologies and their applicability to current and future network-intensive Web applications</li>
            <li>Bringing edge-computing capabilities to Web applications</li>
            <li>Impact of integrating QUIC in the Web Platform</li>
          </ul>

              Becoming a Sponsor
            </h3>
            <p>
              W3C Workshops, meetups, and other events bring you into direct
              contact with leading Web technology experts: representatives from
              industry, research, government, and the developer community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether your interests are focused on a particular topic being
              discussed by a Working Group, or you wish to reach a diverse
              international audience setting, your sponsorship will help
              your organization engage W3C&#39;s participants in its strategic direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sponsorships offset a portion of our meeting costs, so W3C welcomes
              multiple sponsors for each event. All proposals for sponsorship are
              subject to W3C approval.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you&#39;re interested in being a sponsor of the W3C Web &amp; Virtual
              Reality Workshop, please contact J. Alan Bird, Global Business
              Development Leader, at &lt;<a href=
